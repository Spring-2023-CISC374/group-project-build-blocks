# group-game-project

This assignment is where you will submit your code for your MVP as well as the rest of the versions of your educational game.

Michael Snead - Created the basic environment, the crane which can move around and pick up crates, and crates which can be picked up by the crane
                (see basic-environment and basic-crane branches)

JD Wang - Setup file structure, copied configs from first-phaser3-typescript project. Created a simple parser for our block programming language. The parser is made using ANTLR4. There's also a text based code editor demo in feat-text-based-editor branch. The code editor is made using ace.js and ANTLR4 parser. See src/ANTLR4 for the language grammar file and public/editor.html for the code editor. There are some utility library located at src/scripts/utils/ (see feat-file-structure, feat-code-parser, feat-text-based-editor)
